# Spatial-Epidemic-Model
This a Monte Carlo Simulation of the spread of an epidemic that keeps track of the movement of the agents.
- This mini project has been inspired from Problem Set 4 of course Computational Thinking With Julia (Spring 2020) taught by Professor David P. Sanders and Professor Alan Edelman.
- A better look at the notebook can be achieved by downloading it as the most creative and amazing plots require Interact which won't be rendered outside Jupyter Notebook environment.
- The Julia version used here is 1.6.1.
